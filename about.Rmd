### About this site

The website is constructed using R Markdown (.Rmd) that renders to html. The default page is written in index.Rmd, and formatting is defined by _site.yml that applies to each page. For example, codes in _site.yml links navigation bar "Home" to default page, email icon to my email, positions navigation bars as defined etc. Description of the homework project can be found at "About" page. Source code for creating plotly plots can be accessed at code page under data manipulation. The website is hosted at GitHub.

R packages I used for the project are flexdashboard, tidyverse, viridis, p8105.datasets, and plotly. The data NY NOAA I used for plotting is inside p8105.datasets.
